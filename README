This is a Node.js application that functions as an HTTP API to Hacker News
(news.ycombinator.com). This project is in no way affiliated with Hacker News,
and is likely to break should the Hacker News layout change in any way.

To use this application you will need to do the following:

1. git submodule init
2. git submodule update
3. node hn.js

You can now query the API at http://localhost:8124

The response will be a list of JSON objects of the following form:

{
    "id":           "1492835",
    "headline":     "Drowning Doesn't Look Like Drowning",
    "url":          "http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/",
    "score":        "283",
    "submitter":    "msg",
    "comments":     "89",
    "age":          "9 hours ago"
}

Currently the list will reflect the 30 articles listed on the front page of
Hacker News, but I plan to add support for other lists as well.
